# CELO201-MARKETPLACE PROJECT

After going throught the **CELO 201** course, i built this marketplace using the Celo boilerplate. Users can mint their own custom ERC-721  from the *CREATION LABS* page, which will be automatically uploaded to IPFS and be displayed on the *ON SALE* page. On the very page, anyone with CELO tokens is able to purchase the newly created NFT and this will automaticallly reflect on the *MY NFTs* page.
